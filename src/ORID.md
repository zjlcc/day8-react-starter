### O (Objective)
**What did you learn?**
- Learned the basics of **Mapper** and **Flyway** for data mapping and database migration.
- Used a **Concept Map** to organize previous backend knowledge.
- Learned how to write **React components** and use `props` for data passing.

### R (Reflective)
**How do you feel about this?**
- I feel more confident in React, especially in understanding component data flow with `props`.
- The concepts of Mapper and Flyway helped me understand backend database management better.

### I (Interpretive)
**How do you understand this?**
- **Mapper** simplifies object-to-database mapping.
- **Flyway** helps manage database migrations with version control.
- **React** components communicate via `props`, enabling better data flow and reusable components.

### D (Decisional)
**What will you do next?**
- Practice using **Flyway** in a project to manage database migrations.
- Build more **React components** to reinforce the use of `props`.
- Apply **Mapper** for efficient database operations in backend projects.
